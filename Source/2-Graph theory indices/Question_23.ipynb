    "Let's start by talking about the clustering coefficient (CC). We observed that the CC of the DTF network (.53) was considerably greater than that of PDC network (.31). the clustering coefficient of a node is a measure of the probability that two randomly selected \"friends\" of that node are \"friends\" themselves. Ergo, a high average clustering coefficient for a network suggest the ability of that network to highlight group-forming. It then turns out that the DTF MVAR estimator better highlights the connections among brain areas performing related functions than the PDC MVAR estimator.\n",

    "Contrary to what has been observed in the CC case, the average path length of the PDC network (1.79) was slightly higher than twice that of the DTF network (.87). The average path length represents the average of the shortest path length, averaged over all pairs of nodes. a low average path length for a network suggests that the network is able to highlight all the shortest possible connections among nodes. In our case, the DTF network was better having mean path length of half that of the PDC network."
