# Neurology-Brain-Oscillatory-and-Network-Activity-during-Resting-state
Neural oscillations are repetitive patterns of neural activity in the central nervous system. In this paper,we  analyzed  two  datasets  of  EEG  data  for  a  single  subject  at  rest  in  (i)  eyes-open  and  (ii)  eyes-closedconditions, respectively. On those datasets, we established the connectivity of the brain signals using twodifferent MVAR Estimators before computing various graph theory indices. Additionally, we performed motifanalysis to investigate the presence of 3/4-node configurations in the network. Finally, we studied the variouscommunities present in the network using the Louvain algorithm

PS: Disregard the motifs table, issue in presentation
